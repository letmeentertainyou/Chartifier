changelog:
v0.2.0
Added chord weighing algorithms in python and js.
Added deepCopy and xfill to js/tools.js


v0.2.5
Added first draft string padding, the spacing is still awkward and I may need a custom font for this. 
Added ♯ and ♭ characters to the document.
Changed the strum pattern algorithm to be more accurate and switched js to use pre-rendered 
data this doesn't really effect the page load time but it did remove a lot of math from
Chartifier.html, and allows me to render much larger groups of 8th notes ahead of time.
