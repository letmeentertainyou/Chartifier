changelog:
v0.2.0
Added chord weighing algorithms in python and js.
Added deepCopy and xfill to js/tools.js


v0.2.5
Added first draft string padding, the spacing is still awkward and I may need a custom font for this. 
Added ♯ and ♭ characters to the document.
Changed the strum pattern algorithm to be more accurate and switched js to use pre-rendered 
data this doesn't really effect the page load time but it did remove a lot of math from
Chartifier.html, and allows me to render much larger groups of 8th notes ahead of time.


v0.2.6
Cleaned up the python code so that main.py matches main.js again.


v0.3.0
O(N! * length) -> O(N)
Wrote a brand new algorithm for calculating strum patterns which is basically infinitely faster than 
using permutations. What used to take 70mins - uncountable time now takes a single millisecond. While this 
change doesn't effect the front end, I was really motivated to solve the problem. I could easily use 
this algorithm in the front end again, and generate truly custom rhythmic options.

Improved rhythm_permutations algorithm further.
