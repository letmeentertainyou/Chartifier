The rest of these changes are going to require taking some web dev courses, so
updates may slow down before I get the html looking nicer. I hope to finish this stuff soon.

    *radio buttons for key/rhythm
    *make page dynamically flexible.
    *mobile support (probably works now but needs testing)

changelog:
v0.2.0
Added chord weighing algorithms in python and js.
Added deepCopy and xfill to js/tools.js

v0.2.5
Added first draft string padding, the spacing is still awkward and I may need a custom font for this. 
Added ♯ and ♭ characters to the document.
Changed the strum pattern algorithm to be more accurate and switched js to use pre-rendered 
data this doesn't really effect the page load time but it did remove a lot of math from
Chartifier.html, and allows me to render much larger groups of 8th notes ahead of time.

v0.2.6
Cleaned up the python code so that main.py matches main.js again.

v0.3.0
O(N! * M) -> O(Nᴹ)
Wrote a brand new algorithm for calculating strum patterns which is basically infinitely faster than 
using permutations. What used to take 70mins to uncountable time now takes under a second. While this 
change doesn't effect the front end, I was really motivated to solve the problem. I could easily use 
this algorithm in the front end again, and generate truly custom rhythmic options.

v0.3.1
Updated readme,
Improved rhythm_permutations algorithm further.
OLD for size = 30
real    0m56.847s
user    0m53.768s
sys     0m3.073s

NEW for size = 30
real    0m1.507s
user    0m1.459s
sys     0m0.049s

35X time improvement.

v0.3.2
Updated LICENSE to MIT.
Rewrote README
Cleaned up python/rhythm.py a bit. 

v0.3.5
Finally added detailed doc strings on every python/js file.
Updated README again.
Made a src dir for the browser relevant code.

v0.3.6
Another algo speed up for rhythm.py. If the size is even, and sum_slice == size -1,
and two is the smallest int in start then we can continue here.

OLD for size = 35
real    0m13.657s
user    0m13.474s
sys     0m0.179s

NEW for size = 35
real    0m11.421s
user    0m11.302s
sys     0m0.118s

Sick two second time save, sweet!
